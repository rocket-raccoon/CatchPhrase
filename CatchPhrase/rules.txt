1)  Divide players into two teams.  Ideally, situate players in a circle where no player is next to another person on the same team.

2)  Starting with any player, start the Catch Phrase game.  A screen will show up with a phrase along with a timer.  The goal is for the person holding the device to describe the phrase without using any words in the phrase and have a teammate guess the phrase.  If the team correctly guesses it, they pass device to the next person on the opposing team.

3)  If the timer runs out, the opposing team of the person holding the device gains a point.

4)  Additionally, the opposing team will have a chance to guess the phrase in what is called the rebuttal.  If they guess correctly, they gain an additional point.

5)  This games continues indefinitely until you choose to end the game.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!
